# Unhide Selected

Addon made for Blender 4.1 to unhide any "hidden in viewport" objects you have selected in the outliner using a default keybinding of Ctrl + Alt + H.
Preferences include an option to invert the visbility (off by default).

I couldn't fathom why this wasn't built in functionality so I cobbled this together from snippets from the API reference and StackExchange.
